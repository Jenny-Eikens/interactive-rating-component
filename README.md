## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to work with CSS grid in order to get a better feel for how it works. I tend to only work with flexbox as I feel more comfortable with it.
I would also like to work with Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap in future projects. For this current project, I ended up using plain CSS. I initially tried to implement React-Bootstrap but found it too difficult to figure out how to change/override the predefined styles, so I decided to stick with creating my own stylesheet. On this note, I also plan to implement Sass in future projects, as I found myself repeating myself a lot in my stylesheet and defining the same or similar styles for many of my elements.
This was my first project built with React. I really enjoyed working with the component-based structure of React, though I did stumble into a fair bit of challenges along the way, which showed me that I definitely have a lot more to learn and understand about React (especially regarding state variables). I hope to be able to refine my React skills in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Leonardo](https://leonardocolor.io/#) - This helped me with figuring out color schemes and extracting colors from images. I really liked this resource and will use it going forward.
- [MDN article on CSS aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) - This is an amazing article which helped me better understand how aspect-ratio works. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
